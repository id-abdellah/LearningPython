# Dealing with data in python
# ---------------------------------


# Every app that we write, contains code + data
# To structure the data we need to categorize "numbers, strings, boolean"
# Data stored on computer memory
# We use variable to refer to this data
# Variables not containing the data itself, its only refers to its location on the memory
